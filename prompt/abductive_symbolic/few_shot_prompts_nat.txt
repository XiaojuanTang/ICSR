Statement: Laura is $r4$ of Felix.
Answer: To prove the statement "Laura is $r4$ of Felix.", we can use the following logical rule and facts:
Logical Rule: L3: If A is $r1$ of B and A is $r44$, then A is $r4$ of B.
Facts:
F2: Laura is $r1$ of Felix.
F37: Laura is $r44$.
Using L3, F2 and F37, we can conclude that "Laura is $r4$ of Felix" holds.
Therefore, the selected rule and facts are L3, F2, F37.

Statement: Samuel is $r3$ of Alina.
Answer: To infer the statement "Samuel is $r3$ of Alina.", we can use the logical rule L2: If B is $r1$ of A and B is $r1$ of C and A is $r43$, then A is $r3$ of C, we can substitute A with Samuel and C with Alina: L2: If B is $r1$ of Samuel and B is $r1$ of Alina and Samuel is $r43$, then Samuel is $r3$ of Alina. Now, we need to find all facts that match the conditions "B is $r1$ of Samuel", "B is $r1$ of Alina" and "Samuel is $r43$". We have:
F27: Patrick is $r1$ of Samuel.
F28: Patrick is $r1$ of Alina.
F47: Samuel is $r43$.
Based on these facts, we can apply the logical rule L2 to infer "Samuel is $r3$ of Alina":
If Patrick is $r1$ of Samuel and Patrick is $r1$ of Alina and Samuel is $r43$, then Samuel is $r3$ of Alina.
Therefore, the selected rule and facts are L2, F27, F28, F47.

Statement: Patrick is $r7$ of David.
Answer: To explain the statement "Patrick is $r7$ of David.", we can use the logical rule L6: If A is $r1$ of B and B is $r1$ of C and A is $r43$, then A is $r7$ of C. We can substitute A with Patrick and C with David: L6: If Patrick is $r1$ of B and B is $r1$ of David and Patrick is $r43$, then Patrick is $r7$ of David. Now, we need to find all facts that match the conditions "Patrick is $r1$ of B", "B is $r1$ of David" and "Patrick is $r43$". We have:
F28: Patrick is $r1$ of Alina.
F7: Alina is $r1$ of David.
F45: Patrick is $r43$.
By applying L6 with these facts, we can infer that "Patrick is $r7$ of David" holds. Therefore, the selected rule and facts are L6, F28, F7, F45.

Statement: Amelie is $r22$ of Elena.
Answer: To prove the statement "Amelie is $r22$ of Elena.", we can use the following logical rule and facts:
Logical Rule: L21: If B is $r1$ of A and A is $r44$, then A is $r22$ of B.
Facts:
F20: Elena is $r1$ of Amelie.
F43: Amelie is $r44$.
Using L21, F20 and F43, we can conclude that "Amelie is $r22$ of Elena" holds. Therefore, the selected rule and facts are L21, F20, F43.

Statement: Claudia is $r2$ of Felix.
Answer: To prove the statement "Claudia is $r2$ of Felix.", we can use the following logical rule and facts:
Logical Rule: L1: If B is $r1$ of A and B is $r1$ of C and A is $r44$, then A is $r2$ of C.
We can substitute A with Claudia and C with Felix: L1: If B is $r1$ of Claudia and B is $r1$ of Felix and Claudia is $r44$, then Claudia is $r2$ of Felix. Now, we need to find all facts that match the conditions "B is $r1$ of Claudia", "B is $r1$ of Felix" and "Claudia is $r44$". We have:
F3: Laura is $r1$ of Claudia.
F2: Laura is $r1$ of Felix.
F40: Claudia is $r44$.
By applying L1 with these facts, we can infer that "Claudia is $r2$ of Felix" holds. Therefore, the selected rule and facts are L1, F3, F2, F40.
